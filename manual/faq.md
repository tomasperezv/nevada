# FAQ

#### Can I create a coffeescript component?

We don't recommend it but feel free to do it. It's deprecated and we will remove this feature in next releases.

#### Should I have previous experience working with redux?

Nop for simple components but if you need something more complex [Redux website](redux.js.org) is a good starting point.
